the hangman game. (kremala pou len kai sto xwrio mou)

the program takes as an input a word which can contain as many letters as 
you like and it displays it like this:

petros
_ _ _ _ _ _


then it takes a letter as an input, and if it exists in the word
it replaces the correct letter.

guess=p
p _ _ _ _ _

guess=r
p _ _ r _ _


you have 6 lives in total and when you make a mistake the program
starts "hanging" you:
  |
  O
 /|\    6 lives= 1 head, 1 body, 2 arms, 2 legs
 / \ 

when you find the solution or you get hanged, the program terminates itself.

good luck.
